Here In this project I have used NODEJS, EXPRESS for Backend and the for Views files ejs as view engine.
The features for authors is to add authors and then later on edit, delete or view them.
And then we add books with all the main data and select the author from author list and upload picture of book.
We can simply search author according to some conditions.
Before trying this make sure you have already installed the dependencies:
Node
Express
MongoDB
mongoose
ejs
multer
More functionality can be added to this further.
